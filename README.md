## Description 

DIY-Spectrometer-New is an improved version of [DIY Spectrometer](https://github.com/Meg4Byte/Spectrometer.git). This version includes several new features and enhancements over the original project.

## Comparison with Original Project
| Feature          |  Old | New |
|:------------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------------:|
|          Source of grating         | CD                   | DVD
|  Grating position| Attached on camera      | Can be placed anywhere in the box          |
| Modularity        | Limited               | High          |

## Key Improvements

#### DVD instead of CD:

1. Higher line density
2. Wider spectrum visibility
3. Greater dispersion angle 
  
#### Diffraction grating position:

1. No longer attached to the camera
2. Offers wider range of positions for camera placement
3. Doesn't have noise in measurements found in old build due to glare from CD 

#### Easier to improve:

1. In the new build you can also use collimators to futher focus the incoming light rays 
2. You can use mirrors to direct light beams depending on where you place grating and camera
